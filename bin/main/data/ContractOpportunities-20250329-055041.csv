Emergency service work will occur as conditions dictate. Period of Performance This service contract will be for a Base Year, with four (4) one-year options renewable at the discretion of the VA. INFECTION CONTROL MANUAL CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS VAMC, PROVIDENCE, RI FOR INFECTION CONTROL-1 PURPOSE To minimize the risk of infection during maintenance by maintaining the integrity of the environment. APPLICATION Will be determined by Chief of Facilities Management Service and Nurse Epidemiologist. EQUIPMENT REQUIRED Sheet fire retardant polyethylene, or other impervious barrier material, air moving and filtration devices , duct tape, clips, framing, and other materials or devices as needed. Sanders, power saws, etc. will have and will use built in dust collections systems as outlined in the specifications. COMMUNICATIONS The manager of the department where the work will take place, Facilities Management Services, Police and Security Service, Office of Safety and Infection Control Department will be notified of and /or involved in (as appropriate) the project prior to the start of work, including any pre-project meetings. Problems relating to infection control that arise, at any time, will be reported to the coordinator or to the department manager, as soon as possible. 5. PROCEDURE The area in which the project will occur shall be isolated from the adjacent areas in the following manner unless an exception is authorized by the service chief of the area. Determine if the HVAC system includes return air from the area. If so, divert to exhaust, if possible, add filtering to remove dust before it enters the return air system or block off supply and exhaust grills (closed and covered). Install impervious barriers from floor slab above and wall to wall using framing, clips, and duct tape, as required, to maintain and secure the barrier seal. When work is in an extremely sensitive area such as the OR, double impervious barriers may be used. When ceiling envelopes, chases, and/or spaces are penetrated; barriers will be installed to contain movement of air and debris. Windows must be closed and air ducts shut down or capped, when appropriate. Anterooms (consisting of confined space beyond the barrier) will be provided at entrances to work areas to contain debris and provide workers an area to remove protective clothing or vacuum off clothing except when workers exit directly to the outside of the building. Compressed air will not be used to remove dust from clothing. Walk-off mats will be at the entrance to work areas during project duration. Traffic will be minimized to and from the project site. Alternative travel routes will be planned, as necessary. If elevators or stairways are within the field of project, they must have proper barriers installed. Water damaged areas should be addressed first. This will be done under HEPA filter exhaust and containment. Waste will be bagged. This will reduce aerosol of microbial agent/fungi/spore escaping during the demolition and transport of this material out of the site. The air moving and filtration device will be placed into the containment area and will operate to remove dust particles from air and exhaust to the outside. Negative pressure may be maintained in the site, and a daily record maintained during the project. Before any project begins, workers will receive a mandatory infection control handout for training and instructions. Daily inspections will be conducted and documented during project activities, by management, for contractor compliance with infection control requirements. Disruption, violation of barrier integrity, or loss of negative air must be reported to the project manager immediately. The following are examples of other methods which may be requested as appropriate to specific tasks and circumstances: Water misting of work surfaces to control dust during cutting, sweeping, and tasks which generate dust. Shutting down or covering air vents to project areas during activities prior to the beginning of project and for the duration of the project. Using a ceiling access procedure with a mini enclosure around the work area when activities are required in patient care areas outside of the project site. Sealing all project sites, holes, pipes, conduits, punctures, and/or exposures appropriately. Vacuum off clothes with a filtered vacuum cleaner prior to exiting the work site. Requiring workers to wear clean shoe covers each time they exit the work site when they travel to another area of the facility is necessary. When appropriate, site barricade entrances will have gasketed doors with self-closing, latching hardware, and dampened wall-off mats. Environmental Cleaning Any dust tracked outside of the barrier must be removed immediately and as it accumulates. Cleaning in project areas will be accomplished so as to minimize aerosolizing dust particles and may include use of resin control, damp mop, moist broom and /or HEPA filtered vacuum cleaner. Debris removal from project sites must be by a pre-determined route. Debris will be transported in clean containers with tight fitting covers. When project is complete, a thorough clean up of the area is to be done by personnel prior to turnover to Facilities Management Services for final cleaning and dust barrier removal. The contractor will ensure that gross soiling is removed prior to removal of barriers. Facilities Management Services will treat barriers as debris (above) and remove them in a manner designed to minimize distribution of particles. Thorough final cleaning of all surfaces will be done by Facilities Management Services before the area is used to provide patient care. VA MEDICAL CENTER Infection Control Program INFECTION CONTROL FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHY INFECTION CONTROL IS IMPORTANT Hospital-acquired infections (nosocomial) affect 5 percent of all patients admitted to hospitals in the United States and can cause significant illness or even death. Not all of these infections are preventable; however, studies show that up to 32 percent of hospital acquired infections can be prevented when hospitals employ an active and effective infections control program. Hospitals patients are at risk for infection because the stresses of illness and invasive treatments weaken their immune system. In general, healthy adults who are to be at work do not have the same risk for acquiring infections. Our Infection Control Program is designed to identify and control situations that carry an increased risk for infection and to provide for a safe and healthful environment for patients and staff. During the construction project, you may be asked to do some things a bit differently to ensure that the environment is maintained as safe as possible for all. This information was developed through collaboration with the Infection Control Coordinator, Chief FMS, Safety Officer and Industrial Hygienist to help in explaining infection control aspects of construction in the hospital setting. DUST CONTROL POLICY Determine if the HVAC system includes return air from the construction area. If so, divert to exhaust if possible, add filtering to remove dust before it enters the return air system, or blocking supply and return vents. Install impervious barriers from floor to floor slab above and wall to wall using framing, clips and duct tape as required to maintain and secure the barrier seal. Report disruptions such as holes in the barrier and interruptions in the seal to the project manager immediately. Place the air moving and filtration device into the containment area and operate to remove dust particles from the air. Negative air pressure will always be maintained in the project site at all times during construction. If work is in an extremely sensitive area such as the Operating Room, double barriers may be required. Project site must be completely contained before work begins and all penetrations into the project site must be sealed. Windows must be closed and air ducts shut down or taped. Anterooms (consisting of confined space beyond the barriers) will be provided at entrances to the work area to contain debris and provide an area where workers can remove protective clothing or vacuum off personal clothing except when exiting directly to the outside of the building. Walk-off mats will be at entrances to work areas during project duration. Traffic routes will be pre-determine and traffic to and from the project site will be minimized. The contract period of performance is base + four options.

"W912EP25R0007","Indefinite Delivery Contract for Multi-Discipline Miscellaneous Civil Works and Other Architect and Engineering (A-E) Services Within the Boundaries of the Jacksonville District","1. CONTRACT INFORMATION: This procurement will be conducted in accordance with Public Law 92-582 (Selection of Architects and Engineers or Brooks Act) as implemented in FAR Subpart 36.6. The Government intends to award a target of eight contracts as a result of this announcement. The Government has a target to award four other than small business (OTSB) awards and a goal of four awards to small businesses (SB) with a SB reserve target of 10 awarded task orders. The total capacity of the eight contracts is $83,000,000. The eight contracts will be IDIQ contracts for a period of one year from date of award, with options to extend for four additional years, not to exceed a total of five years. The primary purpose of this contract is to provide A-E services for projects located within the geographic area of Civil Works (CW) responsibility of the Jacksonville District (SAJ) of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) on land, and on protected and unprotected water, to include portions of Florida and Georgia (See Exhibit A – SAJ AOR MAP). The South Atlantic Division (SAD) includes parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Puerto Rico, and the Antilles. The primary purpose of this proposed contract is to provide services for projects located within the SAJ AOR. Secondarily, the contract may be used to provide services throughout the SAD AOR. The contractor will have the right to refuse orders for services to be performed outside the SAJ AOR. Only the Offerors considered most highly qualified (MHQ) will be awarded a contract. IDIQ MATOCs will be negotiated and awarded from this solicitation with subsequent work issued by negotiating firm-fixed price (FFP) task orders. All Offerors responding to this announcement MUST identify to which category they are submitting. All Offerors must state the words, Small Business, or Other than Small Business after the solicitation number in PART I, A, Block 3 of Standard Form 330. A separate SF 330 MUST be submitted for each category in which the firm wants consideration. No one firm will receive more than one award as a result of this solicitation. Small Business (SB) proposals will be evaluated separately for the purpose of selection. That said, SB proposals will be evaluated concurrently (at the same time as, during the same selection board) with the Unrestricted (UNR) pool. A separate board will not be convened for either SB or UNR selections. SBs may submit to compete for one of the SB Reserve (pool) contracts and SBs may also submit to compete for one of the UNR (pool) contracts. SBs must submit separate SF330s for each pool in which they wish to be considered. The North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) code is 541330, which has a small business size standard of $25,500,000 in average annual receipts for its preceding three fiscal years. All interested OTSB A-E Offerors are reminded that the successful firm will be expected to place subcontracts to the maximum practicable extent with small and disadvantaged business concerns in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 95-507 and FAR 19.201(a). If an OTSB (i.e., a large business) is selected for this contract, the firm must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan on the part of work it intends to subcontract. Large business Offerors should keep small and small disadvantaged business concerns in mind when considering qualifications of potential subcontractors and ensure each proposed subcontractor socioeconomic status is clearly identified in the submission of qualifications. See FAR part 19.704 for SB subcontracting plan requirements. NOTE: Small Business Offerors selected for award must comply with the performance of work requirements as stated in FAR 52.219-6 Notice of Total Small Business, and/or FAR 52.219-14, Limitations on Subcontracting. Additionally, Small Business Offerors selected for award must be certified in the System for Award Management (SAM) at the time of submission of a price proposal. This is a requirement for SB concerns eligible under the respective program, which have provided all the required documents to the respective program repository. Large Businesses that are selected for award must comply with FAR 52.219-9 regarding the requirement for a subcontracting plan for that part of the work it intends to subcontract. Large Businesses are required to submit a detailed subcontracting plan during contract negotiations. Offerors must adhere to local legal requirements for conducting business in the State of Florida. Selection for task order negotiations after contract award: The minimum guarantee for each contract will be $10,000; applicable to the base period only. Each task order will be assessed based on whether the task order is appropriate for SB (from reviewing SF330s on file) and set the acquisition aside for SB if it is appropriate. In the event that it is not appropriate to set the acquisition aside for SB, the acquisition will then be opened to the OTSB. Once the MHQ firm is selected, negotiations will be conducted until a fair and reasonable price is achieved. Awarding four contracts in each category (i.e. SB and OTSB) will ensure fair opportunity is given among each of the firms and will follow CECT-ZA Memorandum, Updated Procedures for the Selection of task orders on A-E IDCs. 2. PROJECT INFORMATION: This scope for A-E services will include engineering and design services for civil works projects for the planning, design, construction management, monitoring, operation and maintenance of projects including inland flood risk management, aquatic ecosystem restoration, coastal storm risk management, and navigation. Projects/features may include, but are not limited to, dams, levees, dikes, canals, water control structures (e.g. gates), pump stations, bridges, maintenance dredging for navigation and military channels, beach nourishment, dredge material management areas, and coastal hard structures such as jetties, groins, revetments, breakwaters, and seawalls/bulkheads. Services may include, but are not limited to, design reports, engineering studies, data collection and investigations, estimates of construction costs and schedules, calculations/analyses, site planning, construction plans/drawings and technical specifications suitable for use in competitive bidding processes, and other areas of engineering and design required for a complete and useable project. 3. SELECTION CRITERIA: The selection criteria for this project are listed below in descending order of importance (first by major criterion then by each sub-criterion). Criteria in paragraphs A through F are primary. Criteria in paragraphs G and H are secondary and will only be used as a tiebreaker among Offerors that are essentially technically equal. EP 715-1-7, 29 Feb 2012, Architect-Engineer Contracting in USACE, paragraph 3-8d provides, in pertinent part, that Evaluation Method. A board may use any qualitative method, such as adjectival or color coding, to evaluate and compare the qualifications of the firms relevant to each selection criterion. The board intends to use adjectival ratings in its evaluation of the firms by major and sub-criteria for this procurement. Evaluation of the completeness, accuracy, organization and following of these synopsis/solicitation submission requirement instructions will affect the performance rating of the firm as a record of work quality. A. SPECIALIZED EXPERIENCE AND TECHNICAL COMPETENCE: Offerors must clearly demonstrate experience and competence for engineering and design services through relevant projects completed within the last ten years (measured from the date of this synopsis). Project summaries should document breadth and depth of expertise and technical competence for the following evaluation criteria A.(1) – A.(4). Additional projects may be included in SF 330 Section H. All projects shall be clearly annotated with applicable A-E firms from the team. Images of work products must be clearly annotated with a specific description of what is being presented, and which firm produced the items depicted in the image. A maximum of ten relevant projects of the prime, the subcontractor(s), or both, where relevant engineering work was completed within the past ten years (measured from the date of this synopsis), will be reviewed in PART I, Section F. Of these ten projects, the prime must have performed and completed a minimum of six projects (either as the prime or subcontractor). Joint Venture (JV) submissions shall also provide a minimum of six projects; however, if the JV does not have the minimum projects as a JV Offeror, then the Offeror may supplement with projects performed by the members of the JV in their individual capacities to meet the minimum requirements. Use no more than two pages per project. A Project is defined as a project performed under a single, stand-alone contract and/or a single task order issued under an existing IDIQ contract(s). If multiple work orders are issued for the same scope of work (i.e. investigations, then preliminary, intermediate, and final design), these can be aggregated into a single project. It shall be noted that an IDIQ contract is not a project. Do not combine multiple task orders unrelated to a stand-alone project to create a single project example. Combining multiple task orders under an IDIQ to create a single project will not be compliant with the solicitation criteria, and it will not be evaluated or considered. The contract number or IDIQ number and individual task order number associated with the project in the title must be included for each of the projects. If the project is not 100% complete, note the current percentage and estimated date when the project will be completed for each contract and/or task order. Include the percentage of work self-performed for each contract and/or task order. If proposing as a JV, include the percentage of work self-performed by each JV member. Inland Flood Risk Management: includes but is not limited to, numerical modeling and analysis of surface water and groundwater, geotechnical investigations and analysis, field and laboratory material testing, ability to provide services and deliver products using the Autodesk suite of software, engineering and design support of dams, levees, dikes, canals, water control structures, pump stations and utility systems.

GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY OF FIRM RELATIVE TO THE WORKSITE: Prime Offerors based in or having branch offices in Florida will be given preference, provided there are an adequate number of qualified Offerors for consideration. THE FOLLOWING SECONDARY CRITERIA WILL BE USED AS A TIEBREAKER, IF NECESSARY: G. EXTENT OF PARTICIPATION OF SMALL BUSINESSES: In PART I, Section H, provide a Small Business Participation Plan in accordance with FAR 52.219-8. As a secondary criterion, SAJ will evaluate this information, and offerors demonstrating a greater commitment to small business participation will be evaluated more favorably under this criterion. OTSB businesses shall note that, if selected, their Small Business Subcontracting Plan shall reflect and be consistent with the commitments offered in the Small Business Participation Plan. H. VOLUME OF PAST DoD CONTRACTS AWARDED TO FIRM: Offerors shall provide the volume of work awarded by DoD agencies during the previous 12 months. An IDIQ Contract is not considered applicable for this factor. Volume of work shall be demonstrated in a table format and be categorized by contract, task order, project award, completion dates, and dollar amount. Work previously awarded to the firm by DoD will be reviewed with the objective of effecting equitable distribution of contracts among equally qualified Offerors. 4. ENFORCEABILITY OF PROPOSAL: The proposal must set forth full, accurate, and complete information as required by this announcement. By submission of the offer, the offeror agrees that all items proposed (if applicable e.g., key personnel, subcontractors, etc.) will be used for the duration of the contract and any substitutions shall require prior Contracting Officer approval. The award decision for this contract will be based, in part, on an evaluation of the key personnel and/or subcontractors the Contractor included in its proposal for the positions and/or items of subcontracted work identified in the proposal. The Contractor agrees these key personnel and/or subcontractors will be employed as described in its proposal and no substitutes will be employed without the prior written approval of the Contracting Officer. The Contractor further agrees that any proposed substitutes shall meet or exceed the qualifications of the original personnel and/or subcontractors. If the Contractor proposal did not name a subcontractor for an identified item of work, the Contractor will not be allowed to subcontract that item of work without prior approval of the Contracting Officer. This is not a request for a price proposal. As required by acquisition regulations, interviews to discuss prospective contractors qualifications for the contracts will be conducted only for those Offerors considered most highly qualified after submittal review by the selection board. Interviews will be scheduled after the final selection board has determined the most highly qualified Offerors. 5. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Offerors meeting the requirements described in this announcement and wishing to be considered must submit their SF 330, Part I, for the proposed combined team (firm or joint venture and all subcontractors), and SF 330, Part II, for the firm or joint venture and each subcontractor electronically to PIEE Solicitation Module at https://piee.eb.mil/ system. A firm will not be considered if its SF330 Part I is not signed, unless the SF330 Part I is accompanied by a signed cover letter or a current (within 3 years) signed SF330 Part II.

Typically, these Veterans will be on fixed incomes or be low-wage earners who currently live in units where their incomes cannot keep up with housing inflation or they are living with others without having their name on the lease. While these Veterans may need a modest level of support, service requirements are not expected to be as intensive as those provided for permanent supportive housing (PSH). For purposes of this effort, the Developer would be a non-VA entity who has the qualifications outlined in Section V of this Notice. The Developer will be expected to develop housing at the Campus. The opportunity would involve a Developer entering into an EUL with VA and financing, renovating/constructing, operating, and maintaining the above-noted housing.
